### Project Description
The goal of this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a given data set. This project required the creations of three visualizations to answer three questions pertaining to the data set. Data visualizations were created that tell a story or highlight patterns within the data set.  

### Data Set: Flight Delays and Cancellations
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset and it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. The following files are included in the dataset.

> DAY: day (numerical) the flight occured
> DAY_OF_WEEK: the day of the week the flight occured
> AIRLINE: airline operating the flight
> FLIGHT_NUMBER: specific number assigned to the flight
> TAIL_NUMBER: unique identifier of the aircraft.
> ORIGIN_AIRPORT: airport code where the flight departed
> DESTINATION_AIRPORT: airport code where the flight arrived
> SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE: time the flight was scheduled to depart.
> DEPARTURE_TIME: acutal time of departure.
> DEPARTURE_DELAY: minutes of departure time delay
> TAXI_OUT: time the aircraft spent taxiing on the ground before taking off
